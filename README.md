# greybox copy
This is a Web application to continuously copy clipboards across all connected machines live.

Try it out by going to the URL, and copying text from anywhere on your machine: everything you've copied overwrites the clipboard of everyone using the app at that moment, and everything they put in their clipboard overwrites yours.

Syncronous copy!
